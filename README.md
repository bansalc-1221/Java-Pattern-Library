🎯 Java Pattern Project – BCA 2nd Year
“Where logic meets creativity — a showcase of pattern generation in Java.”

This project demonstrates various console-based pattern designs implemented in Java.
It is built to strengthen the understanding of loops, conditionals, method creation, and user interaction in Java programming.

📌 Project Overview
The Patternproject Java program presents a menu-driven console application allowing the user to select from 17 different pattern styles.
Each pattern is printed dynamically in the console, showcasing different looping techniques and Java fundamentals.

🛠 Key Features
Interactive Menu using Scanner class for user input.

Switch-Case Structure for pattern selection.

Reusable Static Methods — each pattern implemented in a separate function.

Loop-based Designs (nested loops, incremental/decremental logic).

Continuous Execution Option for multiple trials without restarting the program.

📂 Class & Functions Used
Class
Patternproject — The main class containing the entire program logic.

Functions
main(String[] args) – Entry point of the program; calls the menu method.

showPatternMenu() – Displays the list of patterns, takes user choice, and executes the corresponding method.

pattern1() … pattern17() – Individual methods for printing specific patterns.

📦 Java Concepts Demonstrated
Classes & Methods (Encapsulation of logic into functions).

Static Methods (No object creation required to invoke pattern methods).

User Input using java.util.Scanner.

Switch Statements for flow control.

Loop Structures (for, while, nested loops).

Conditional Logic for formatting output.
